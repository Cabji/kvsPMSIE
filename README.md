 Plex Media Server Import Export for watched metadata

This is a small script for KVIrc that will extract the watched movie/show data from the Plex Media Server database file.
You will need to do this if you install PMS onto another or a new machine and you want to retain all your watched metadata.

I don't know why Plex doesn't save watch metadata to the cloud anyway?

This script aims to do what this page details: https://support.plex.tv/articles/201154527-move-viewstate-ratings-from-one-install-to-another/

On Windows, it isn't so easy to do what that page asks, so I wrote this script for KVIrc to make it easier.

You will need KVIrc to use this script: http://kvirc.net/
